# Sidecar-toggle-alfredworkflow

An alfred workflow to toggle Sidecar in Big Sur.

## Mechanism

Work by manipulating System Preference window. The System Preference will be closed automatically when operations are finished.

## Advantage...(for myself)

There other workflows for toggling Sidecar, but they operate through menu bar and Control Center, which requires you to keep menu bar display always on. With my workflow, menu bar is untouched, so it can be hidden automatically for maximizing screen space, especially when you are also using external status bar like [spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar) or [Ã¼bersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht).
